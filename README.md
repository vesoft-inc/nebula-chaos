Chaos framework for the Storage Service

### Plan Intro
#### [clean_wals_restart](conf/clean_wals_restart.json)
Clean all wals of specified space, then start all services, write a circle, then check data integrity.

#### [random_kill_clean_data](conf/random_kill_clean_data_plan.json)
Start all services, disturb (random kill a storage service, clean the data path, restart) while write a circle, then check data integrity.

#### [random_kill](conf/random_kill_plan.json)
Start all services, disturb (random kill and restart a storage service) while write and read.

#### [scale_up_and_down](conf/scale_up_and_down.json)
Start 3 storage servies, add 4th storage service using `balance data` while write a circle, then check data integrity. Then stop 1st storage service, remove it using `balance data` while write a circle then check data integrity. Likewise,
add 1st storage service back and remote the 4th storage service.

#### [random_network_partition](conf/random_network_partition.json)
Start all services, disturb (random drop all packets of a storage service, recover later) while write a circle, then check data integrity. The network partition is based on iptables. **Make sure the user has sudo authority and can execute iptables without password.**

> PS: all storage services in [random_network_partition](conf/random_network_partition.json) and [random_traffic_control](conf/random_traffic_control.json) must be deployed on different ip. The reason is that we don't know the source port of storage service, we can only use ip to indicate the service.

#### [random_traffic_control](conf/random_traffic_control.json)
Start all services, disturb (random delay all packets of a storage service, recover later) while write a circle, then check data integrity. The traffic is based on [tcconfig](https://github.com/thombashi/tcconfig), which is a `tc` command wrapper. Install it at first, since it will use `tc` and `ip` command, use the following scripts to make it has capabilities with not super user.
```
setcap cap_net_admin+ep /usr/sbin/tc
setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+ep /usr/sbin/ip
```
